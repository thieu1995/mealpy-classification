# Hyper-parameter tuning of classification models using Mealpy of:

1. SVM 
2. MLP
3. CNN 


# Notes: Run too slow

1. MLP, CNN: Can't complain, it takes time to train a single neural network


# Environments

```code 

Open terminal in windows:

    python -m venv pve_mealpy_test
    pve_mealpy_test\Scripts\activate.bat
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
```
